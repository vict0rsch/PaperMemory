        This paper is not in your memory, and it can be for one of many reasons:
    </h4>
    <ul>
        <li style="margin-top: 6px">
            You disabled paper recording from non-pdf pages in the menu
        </li>
        <li style="margin-top: 6px">
            You disabled this paper source in the options page
        </li>
        <li style="margin-top: 6px">
            On <strong>Firefox</strong>, content scripts are not triggered on pdfs.
            <ul>
                <li>
                    This is not something I can do anything about, it's a design choice
                    by Firefox developers.

                <li>
                    The extension would work on the paper's
                    <i>abstract</i>
                </li>
                <li>
                    Trigger the extension manually by clicking on the "Try manual
                    trigger" button in the popup.
                </li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li style="margin-top: 6px">
            You deleted the paper (refresh the page to add it back)
        </li>
        <li style="margin-top: 6px">
            Your memory was synced and the remote data did not have the paper (it was
            deleted on another device) (refresh the page to add it back)
        </li>
        <li style="margin-top: 6px">
            There was an error parsing the paper's data (you can check the console if
            you think this is an issue)
        </li>
        <li style="margin-top: 6px">
            You are actually not on a paper page but the extension made a mistake
            thinking so, just ignore this.
