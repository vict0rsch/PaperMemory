    <h3>Deprecation notice: custom title function</h3>
    <p>
        PaperMemory displayed a warning notification because it has detected that you
        are using a
        <span style="text-decoration: underline">custom title function</span>.
    </p>
    <p>
        If it is <em>not</em> the case, meaning you have not changed the function that
        produces a title from a paper in your Advanced Options, you can safely ignore
        this warning.
    </p>
    <p>
        If you <em><strong>do</strong></em> however use a custom title function, be
        aware that this functionality will be removed in version <code>0.6.0</code>.
    </p>

    <h3>Why?</h3>
    <p>Mostly because of safety, code quality and accessibility.</p>
    <p>
        The vision for this feature is to make it modular but not code-based. Something
        like asking you for a list of attributes you want to be part of the title and
        potentially lower/upper case or capitalize.
    </p>
    <p>
        This vision is not fully-shaped but I wanted to give you a proper heads-up to
        give you time to adjust.
    </p>

    <h3>What should you do about it?</h3>
    <p>
        If you're happy with the vision for this feature, you don't have anything to do
        about it.
    </p>
    <p>
        If you want to keep the feature as is, let's go and discuss on
        <a href="https://github.com/vict0rsch/PaperMemory/issues/109">Issue #109</a>!
