# Keep System Architecture Doc Up To Date

## Policy

`system-architecture.md` is the source of truth for the repository architecture.

## Required behavior

When a task changes the system architecture (components, boundaries, data flow, key abstractions, integrations, or deployment topology), update `system-architecture.md` in the same task.

If no architecture impact exists, explicitly confirm that no update is needed.

## Verification checklist

- Architecture-impacting code changes include corresponding `system-architecture.md` updates.
- New or changed architectural terms are reflected consistently.
- Mermaid diagrams remain accurate when affected.
- No secrets are introduced in documentation.
