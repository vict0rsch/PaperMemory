An **automated**, web-based and minimalist reference manager that also finds code repositories and published versions of preprints.

It is not meant to replace, rather complete more standard reference managers as Zotero etc.

This browser extension allows you to automatically store research papers you read, find a code repository and much more:

1. 🏬 **Automatically record papers** you open, without clicking anywhere. You can then **search** them, **tag** them, **comment** them and link a code repository.
2. 💻 **Automatically find code** repositories using PapersWithCode's API
3. 🤝 **Match pre-prints to publications** using 4 different databases
4. 🎬 **Change a pdf's webpage title to the article's title**, because who cares about that saved bookmark `1812.10889.pdf` when it could be `InstaGAN Instance-aware Image-to-Image Translation.pdf`
5. 🎫 **BibTex citation**, because citing papers should not be a hassle you can copy a BibTex citation to your clipboard or export the Memory itself as a `.bib` file
6. 🔗 **Markdown link**, `[title](url)` because it's the little things that make sharing a paper easier (to be used in issues, PRs, Readme, HackMD.io etc.)
7. 🗂 **Direct download button** with a nice name including the paper's title, so that you don't have to open the pdf's webpage and then download it from your browser.
8. 📄 **Go back from a pdf to its abstract page**. For instance: from `https://arxiv.org/pdf/1703.06907.pdf` to `https://arxiv.org/abs/1703.06907` in a click.
9. 🏛️ **Export your data** as a `.json` file or a `.bib` full BibTex export

[📑—About finding published papers from preprints](https://papermemory.org/features/#preprint-matching)

## Privacy

All the data collected is stored locally on your computer and you can export it to `json` it from the options page.

[📑—More on Privacy](https://papermemory.org/features/#privacy)

## Feature requests

I'm regularly adding feature ideas in the [issues](https://github.com/vict0rsch/PaperMemory/issues). Feel free to go upvote the ones you'd like to see happen or submit your own requests.

## Customization

Checkout [📑—All configuration options](https://papermemory.org/configuration/). Here's a quick overview:

<br/>

**a. Customize features in the menu:**

</p>

<br/>

**c. Advanced options**

In the extension's [📑—`options`](https://papermemory.org/configuration/#advanced-options) (right click on the icon or in the popup's menu) you will find advanced customization features:

-   **Auto-tagging**: add tags to papers based on regexs matched on authors and titles
-   **Source filtering**: filter out some paper sources you don't want to record papers from
-   **Custom title function**: provide Javascript code to generate your own web page titles and pdf filenames based on a paper's attributes
-   **Data management**: export/load your memory data and export the bibliography as a `.bib` file
-   **Online Synchronization**: use Github Gists to sync your papers across devices

## Install from source

Refer to [📑—the documentation](https://papermemory.org/getting-started/#from-source).

## Preprints

There currently exists, to my knowledge, no centralized source for matching a preprint to its subsequent published article. This makes it really hard to try and implement best practices in terms of citing published papers rather than their preprint.

My approach with PaperMemory is to try and notify you that a publication likely exists by utilizing the `note` field. You will occasionally notice `Accepted @ X` in a Paper's notes. This will be added automatically if you are on a known published venue's website (as Nature, PMLR or NeurIPS) but also from DBLB, CrossRef.org, SemanticScholar.org, Unpaywall.org or Google Scholar.

There's room for improvement here^, please contact me (an issue will do) if you want to help.

## Discovering Code repositories

PaperMemory uses the PapersWithCode API in order to discover code repositories 🖥️

See [📑—how it works](https://papermemory.org/features/#code-repositories).

## FAQ

[📑—Frequently asked questions](https://papermemory.org/faq/).

## Todo

-   [ ] Improve `Contributing.md`
-   [ ] Write many more tests! **Help is wanted** (it's not so hard to write unittests 😄) (see `Contributing.md`)
